const FAQ = () => {
  const faqs = [
    {
      id: "what-to-bring",
      question: "What should I bring to class?",
      answer: "Just bring yourself and water! We provide high-quality mats, props, and towels. Wear comfortable, stretchy clothing that you can move freely in. Grippy socks are recommended for Pilates classes."
    },
    {
      id: "new-to-class",
      question: "I'm new to Pilates/Yoga. Can I still attend?",
      answer: "Absolutely! All of our classes welcome beginners. Our instructors provide modifications for every exercise, and we encourage you to listen to your body and work at your own pace. Consider starting with our New Student Special to ease into your practice."
    },
    {
      id: "music-volume",
      question: "How loud is the music?",
      answer: "Our music is thoughtfully calibrated for each practice. Pilates classes feature energizing beats at a moderate volume to support focus, while yoga classes use softer, grounding soundscapes. If you have hearing sensitivities, please let your instructor know—we're happy to accommodate."
    },
    {
      id: "pregnancy-postpartum",
      question: "Can I attend classes if I'm pregnant or postpartum?",
      answer: "We welcome pregnant and postpartum bodies! However, we recommend consulting with your healthcare provider before beginning or continuing any exercise program. Our instructors can provide modifications, but medical clearance is always advised for your safety."
    },
    {
      id: "booking-cancellation",
      question: "How do I book classes and what's the cancellation policy?",
      answer: "Book through our online scheduling system. We require 12+ hours notice for cancellations to receive full credit. Late cancellations may incur a fee, and no-shows forfeit the class. This policy helps us manage our small class sizes fairly."
    },
    {
      id: "late-arrival",
      question: "What if I'm running late?",
      answer: "We understand life happens! However, for safety and to avoid disrupting the class flow, we may not be able to accommodate arrivals more than 10 minutes late. We recommend arriving 10-15 minutes early to settle in and connect with your intention."
    },
    {
      id: "membership-options",
      question: "What membership and class pack options do you offer?",
      answer: "We offer flexible options: drop-in classes ($35), 10-class packs ($290, 3-month expiry), 20-class packs ($520, 6-month expiry), and unlimited monthly memberships ($189). New students can try our special introductory offers."
    },
    {
      id: "community-events",
      question: "Do you host community events?",
      answer: "Yes! We regularly host pop-up events featuring local AAPI and women-owned wellness brands, seasonal intention-setting workshops, and community celebrations. Follow us on social media or ask at the front desk for upcoming events."
    },
    {
      id: "showers-changing-rooms",
      question: "Do you have showers or changing rooms?",
      answer: "We do not currently offer showers or full changing rooms at our studio. We have a small area for storing personal items and light changes, but recommend arriving ready to move. Many of our community members enjoy the post-class glow and head to nearby coffee shops!"
    },
    {
      id: "inclusivity",
      question: "What does 'designed to belong' mean?",
      answer: "We believe wellness should be accessible to every body and every story. Our studio centers women and AAPI voices while welcoming all identities. We're committed to creating a brave space where you can show up authentically, start where you are, and grow at your own pace."
    },
    {
      id: "first-time-tips",
      question: "Any tips for my first visit?",
      answer: "Arrive 15 minutes early to check in and get oriented. Don't eat a large meal 2 hours before class. Bring water and let your instructor know it's your first time—we love welcoming new community members! Most importantly, remember that everyone was a beginner once."
